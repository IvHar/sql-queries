## SQL Queries Showcase
This repository includes one SQL file that sets up a small sample database and demonstrates how to run different types of queries. Here you can see:

1. **Table Creation**  
   Several tables (like `continents`, `countries`, `people`, and `citizenships`) are created.
   These tables connect to each other using primary and foreign keys, showing how data can be linked across different entities.

3. **Data Insertion**  
   The file inserts both fixed data (such as lists of continents and countries) and generated data (like random people).
   This helps illustrate how to populate tables in various ways.

4. **Sample Queries**  
   A range of queries is provided to show different SQL features. For example:
   - Finding the country with the largest population
   - Calculating average population density
   - Listing countries by population density
   - Identifying pairs of people with the same name
   - Checking which continent has the most people based on citizenships

5. **How to Use**  
   - Create or use an existing PostgreSQL database.
   - Run scripts for create and insert data
   - Explore the results of the queries. You can also modify or add your own queries to learn more.

6. **Purpose**  
   This file is designed to help you practice creating tables, inserting data, and writing queries that use both simple and advanced SQL techniques.
   It is a useful example for anyone who wants to see how to handle database relationships, work with random data,
   and perform various operations like sorting, filtering, and grouping.

Feel free to adapt this file for learning, testing, or demonstrations of your own SQL skills.
